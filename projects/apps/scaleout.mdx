Scaleout is a pioneering federated machine learning company, joining the IoTeX ecosystem to decentralize the machine learning value chain from data collection to model usage/access. As a first step, Scaleout will develop a protocol for contributor-owned machine learning models that will be trained with verifiable data from Pebble Tracker, allowing anyone to mine tokens by contributing their data to various models. The end goal is to develop an end-to-end solution for decentralized machine learning, including trusted collaboration, smart contract-based model governance, and on-chain serving of machine learning predictions.
