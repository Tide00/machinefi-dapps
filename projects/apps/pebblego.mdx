Pébble GO is a dApp running on the IoTeX blockchain, designed as a space for trading and exchanging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through “proof of presence” by utilizing trusted wearables and trackers to verify claims of location. In simple terms, Pébble GO will help connect physical and virtual worlds through blockchain-based verification of actual presence with the use of trusted devices, a brand new way of connecting different spheres of life.
